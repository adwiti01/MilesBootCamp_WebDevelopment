                Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people,
                in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an
                outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors". 
                "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign except that it is 
                pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

                The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is played by tapping a fist on an open 
                palm three times, and then forming one of the mentioned items. A rock 
                is represented by a closed fist, paper is done with an open hand and 
                palm facing down, and scissors are represented by holding the first 
                two fingers straight to form the letter V.
